# New York Taxi Trip Duration Prediction using Deep Learning 

**Introduction**    
Predicting travel time is essential for transportation logistics, ride-sharing platforms, and city planning. This project uses the NYC Taxi Trip Duration dataset to build models capable of accurately estimating taxi trip durations using machine learning and deep learning models.

**Goal**: Build accurate and efficient models to support 
transportation analytics

**Project Workflow**    
**Step 1**: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering        
**Step 2**: Exploratory Data Analysis     
**Step 3**: Baseline Modeling (Linear & Logistic Regression)     
**Step 4**: Deep Learning Model Development     
**Step 5**: Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation    
**Step 6**: Model Evaluation & Performance Analysis     
 
**Objective**     
**Objective 1** – RegressionPredict the exact trip duration (in seconds) based on trip features    
**Objective 2** – ClassificationCategorize trip duration into: Short/ Medium/ Long 

Hyperparameters such as the number of units, dropout rate, batch size, and epochs were tuned using Grid Search with 5-fold cross-validation. To optimize the deep learning models, we performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and K-fold cross-validation. 
1. Cross-Validation Setup 
2. Regression Model Tuning 
3. Classification Model Tuning
After performing grid search with 5-fold cross-validation, the best hyperparameter configurations for both the regression and classification models were identified.
